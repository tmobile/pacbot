# Introduction
Policy as Code Bot (PacBot) is a platform for continuous compliance monitoring, compliance reporting and security automation for the cloud. In PacBot, security and compliance policies are implemented as code. All resources discovered by PacBot are evaluated against these policies to gauge policy conformance. PacBot auto-fix framework provides the ability to automatically respond to policy violations by taking predefined actions. PacBot packs in powerful visualization features, it gives a simplified view of compliance and makes it easy to analyze and remediate policy violations. PacBot is more than a tool to manage cloud misconfiguration, it is a generic platform that can be used to do continuous compliance monitoring and reporting for any domain.

## More Than Cloud Compliance Assessment
PacBot's plugin-based data ingestion architecture allows ingesting data from multiple sources. We have built plugins to pull data from Qualys Vulnerability Assessment Platform, Bitbucket, TrendMicro Deep Security, Tripwire, Venafi Certificate Management, Redhat Satellite, Spacewalk, Active Directory and few other custom built internal solutions. We are working to open source these plugins and other tools as well. You could write rules based on data collected by these plugins to get a complete picture of your ecosystem and not just cloud misconfigurations. For example, within T-Mobile, we have implemented a policy to mark all EC2 instances with one or more severity 5 (CVSS score > 7) vulnerabilities as non-complaint.

## How Does It Work?
**Assess -> Report -> Remediate -> Repeat**

Assess -> Report -> Remediate -> Repeat is PacBot's philosophy. PacBot discovers resources and assesses these resources against the policies implemented as code. All policy violations are recorded as an issue. Whenever an Auto-Fix hook is available with the policies, those auto-fixes are executed when the resources fail the evaluation. Policy violations cannot be closed manually, the issue has to be fixed at the source and PacBot will mark it closed in the next scan. Exceptions can be added to policy violations. Sticky exceptions (Exception based on resource attribute matching criteria)can be added to exempt the similar resources that may be created in future.


PacBot's Asset Groups are a powerful way to visualize compliance. Asset Groups are created by defining one or more target resource's attribute matching criteria. For example, you could create an Asset Group of all running asset by defining criteria to match all EC2 instances with attribute instancestate.name=running. Any new EC2 instance launched after the creation of the Asset Group will be automatically included in the group. In PacBot UI you can select the scope of the portal to a specific asset group. All the data points shown in the PacBot portal will be confined to the selected Asset Group. Team's using cloud can set the scope of the portal to their application or org and focus only on their policy violations. This reduces noise and provides a clear picture to our cloud users. In T-Mobile, we create Asset Group per stakeholder, per application, per AWS account, per Environment etc.

Asset groups are not for just setting the scope of the data shown in the UI. It can be used to scope the rule executions as well. PacBot policies are implemented as one or more rules. These rules can be configured to run against all resources or a specific Asset Group. The rules will evaluate all resources in the asset group configured as the scope for the rule. This provides an opportunity to write policies which are very specific to an application or Org. A good example is, some of the teams would like to enforce additional tagging standards apart from the global ones set for all of the cloud. They implement this policy with their custom rules and configure that to run only on their assets.

## Installation

Detailed installation instructions are available [here](https://github.com/tmobile/pacbot/wiki/Install)


## Usage

The installer will launch required AWS services listed in the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tmobile/pacbot/wiki/Install). After successful installation hit the UI load balancer URL. Login into the application using the credentials supplied during the installation. The results from the policy evaluation will start getting populated within an hour. Trendline widgets will be populated when there are at least two data points.


When you install PacBot, the AWS account where you install is the source account. PacBot installed on the source account can monitor other target AWS accounts. Refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/tmobile/pacbot/wiki/Install) to add new accounts to PacBot. By default source account will be monitored by PacBot.


Login as Admin user and go to the Admin page from the top menu. In the Admin section, you can 
1. Create/Manage Policies
2. Create/Manage Rules and associate Rules with Policies
3. Create/Manage Asset Groups
4. Create/Manage Sticky Exception
5. Manage Jobs
6. Create/Manage Access Roles
7. Manage PacBot Configurations

See detailed instruction with screenshots on how to use the admin feature [here](https://github.com/tmobile/pacbot/wiki/Admin-Features
